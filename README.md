A simple python program to extract domain name from raw urls
I am basically creating this tool to script in python.
My intention to create this tool is basically for masshunting multiple domains at once.
If you try to find a bug bounty program using google dorks.
You can extract all the urls using a tool like SEO SERP Extraction Tool
Since the results returned by the above tool is basically raw urls.
You can run it against this tool to extract the domain names.
Which can be used for running subdomain enumerations or other similar attacks.
